<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About Grocer: Grocery Store Manager
<br>

<!-- TODO: ADD SCREENS -->

<br>
Grocer is a web app that makes it easier for Grocery Store owners to focus on their business growth rather than wasting time on management. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Xampp & Apache. The best UI you will see for a management system web app, Grocery is your key to:
<br><br>

1. Simplified in-store inventory management: Grocer offers a user-friendly interface for store owners to easily add, remove, and edit product details like name, price, quantity, and quality. This eliminates the need for manual record-keeping and streamlines stock management.
2. Improved data accuracy and organization: By centralizing product information in a digital platform, Grocer minimizes errors and ensures consistent, accessible data for informed decision-making.
3. Enhanced employee management: Streamlining employee data management with add/remove functionality simplifies administrative tasks and helps maintain accurate personnel records.
4. Cost-effective solution: Grocer requires no initial hardware investment and relies on web-based access, making it a more affordable option compared to traditional inventory management systems.

Key features of Grocer:

1. Inventory Management: Add, remove, edit product details (name, quantity, price, quality).
2. Employee Management: Add, remove, edit employee data.
3. Product Overview: View comprehensive list of all available products with key details.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `git` installed, type `git --version` in your cmd. (git official download page: https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  
```
git --version
```
<br>

Also, install `xampp` to run the project on localhost. (xampp download link: https://www.apachefriends.org) <br>
Installation process: https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/tools/xampp-tutorial-create-your-own-local-test-server/

### Installation

Steps to install code into your local device and run using localhost:

1. Fork this repository (and leave a star if you like) by click on the `fork` button on the top right side.
2. From your copy of this repo located `grocer-grocery-store-manager`, copy the code link: `https://github.com/your-user-name/grocer-grocery-store-manager.git`
3. Locate to: `C://xampp/htdocs/`
4. Open terminal and locate to `htdocs`

```
cd C://xampp/htdocs
```
<br>

5. Clone your copy of this repo using `git clone link-you-copied-in-step-2`

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/your_username_/doable-todo-list-app.git
  ```
<br>

6. Rename `grocer-grocery-store-manager` folder to `myFolder`
7. Open the folder `myFolder` in your code editor (I use VS Code) & start coding.
8. Download PHP Extensions in VS Code
9. Run Apache and MySQL in Xampp
10. Go to Chrome Browser and go to `http://localhost/myFolder/` to run the program

8. Download PHP Extensions in VS Code
9. Run Apache and MySQL in Xampp
10. Go to Chrome Browser and go to `http://localhost/myFolder/` to run the program
11. Create a database named `grocer` with 3 tables in `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`

12. Navigate to the root folder of this project
  
  ```
  cd C://xampp/htdocs/myFolder

  ```
<br>

13. DO **NOT** MAKE CHANGES TO THE main BRANCH, create your own branch and name it your name

```
git branch my-user-name
```
<br>

14. Confirm that your new branch `my-user-name` is created

```
git branch
```
<br>

15. Select your new branch `my-user-name` and work on that branch only

```
git checkout my-user-name
```
<br>

16. Confirm that you are in your branch `my-user-name` and **NOT** on `main`

```
git branch
```
<br>

<h2>Staying up-to-date with original code: </h2>

1. You have to shift to `main` branch first but do **NOT** `push` to `main` branch

```
git checkout main
```
<br>

2. Perform a `pull` to stay updated. It must show `Already up-to-date`

```
git pull
```
<br>

3. Now you have to shift back to your branch `my-user-name` again before you can continue editing code

```
git checkout my-user-name
```
<br>

4. Perform a `pull` again in `my-user-name` your own branch

```
git pull
```
<br>

<h2>Once you are ready to push the changes, follow these steps: </h2>

1. Confirm you are in `my-user-name` your own branch

```
git branch
```
<br>

2. Push the changes

```
git add .
git commit -m "issue #24 fixed"
```
<br>

3. Choose `git push origin HEAD`, do **NOT** choose `git push origin HEAD:master`

```
git push
git push origin HEAD
```
